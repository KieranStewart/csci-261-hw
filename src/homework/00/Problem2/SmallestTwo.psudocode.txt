find smallest two(array):
    set smallest number to the first element of the array
    go through each element e of the array 
        replace smallest with e if it is smaller
    now go through each element e the array
        set second smallest to e if:
            (it is smaller then second smallest 
            or second smallest is not initialized)
            and e is not the smallest
    return smallest and second smallest
