getPrimes (n):
    if n is less than 2 then return an empty array

    create an empty array to hold the primes
    let i = 2
    for each number i from 2 to n (inclusive):
        check if i is divisable by the numbers in the primes array.
        if it isn't, add it to the primes array. 
    return the primes array
